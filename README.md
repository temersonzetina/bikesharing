## Bringing Bikeshare to Des Moines: An Analysis of NYC

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to display key trends in bikesharing in New York City during the month of August, 2017. These indicators were rendered via various plots in a Tableau story. This story is meant to support the founders of a bikesharing business in Des Moines, who hope to leverage data from NYC to inform the strategy to be employed in their city.

### Results
I have described the results from each of the visualizations below, as well as any corresponding insights.

#### Total rides

In August of 2017, there were roughly 2.3M individual bike rides in NYC. This is roughly 1 ride for very 4 NYC residents. If the founders were to replicate this level of participation in Des Moines, they would see nearly 55K rides in a comparably successful month.

#### Rentals by starting point

Bike rentals were clustered in certain areas of the city. The founders will want to carefully select similar areas on Des Moines.

#### Checkout times for users

The great majority of trips were under 20 minutes.

#### Checkout times by gender

Men appear to access bikeshare at the highest rates in NYC. It is unclear whether this finding applies to Des Moines.

#### Trips by weekday (per hour)
![Usage by weekday](https://github.com/temersonzetina/bikesharing/blob/main/usagebyweekday.png)
Bike rentals correspond with daily commute times during the weekdays.

#### Trips by gender for each hour of weekday

Usage times don't seem to vary much by gender.

#### User-type trips by gender for each weekday

Driving subscriptions should be the top priority in terms of sales (over, for instance, one-off rides or vacationers in need of short transport).

### Summary
The results from this analysis suggest that we should (1) think big when setting goals for rider participation, (2) carefully select bike parking locations to mirror commute patterns, and (3) market subscriptions to regular users. For a city like Des Moines - one of the midwest's largest cities and Iowa's business and cultural hub - it is reasonable to expect that we could replicate NYC's results (in a way that is proportional to our population). In terms of the gender data, we should consider carefully how to interpret and apply these insights. One potential application is to target aggressively to men, given that they appear to be the highest-usage riders. Another interpretation of the gender data is that bikesharing in NYC has badly under-marketed to women, and that this is a huge area of opportunity for us to build upon in Des Moines. My recommendation would be that we attempt to close the gender usage gap and, in so doing, significantly increase overall ridership by focusing on subscriptions for women commuters.
